# 🎵 Amazon Music Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **unsupervised machine learning (K-Means clustering)** to group songs based on their audio features.

## 🎯 Objective
To analyze song characteristics and automatically cluster similar tracks using:

- Data Cleaning
- Feature Selection
- Data Normalization
- K-Means Clustering
- Elbow Method
- Silhouette Score
- PCA (for visualization)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📊 Key Steps
1. Data preprocessing
2. Feature scaling
3. Finding optimal K (Elbow & Silhouette)
4. K-Means clustering
5. PCA visualization
6. Cluster interpretation

## 📈 Results
Songs were successfully grouped into clusters showing distinct patterns in:
- Danceability
- Energy
- Loudness
- Acousticness
- Tempo

## ✅ Conclusion
Clustering helps understand music patterns and can support recommendation systems.
